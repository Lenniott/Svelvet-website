### Roadmap

Please refer to the [roadmap](https://svelvet.mintlify.app/roadmap) for the full list of ideas for iteration. <br>
Some ideas inspired by v8.0.0 include:

- **Example Showcase:** we've added a new section to the documentation which will contain example sandboxes of features and potential usecases of Svelvet. If you would like to contribute to the showcase with an example of how you‚Äôre using Svelvet, reach out to the team with your project via [Github discussion](https://github.com/open-source-labs/Svelvet/discussions/categories/project-showcase).
- **Additional functionality to the Drawer Component:** we are planning to make updates to address the ablity to 1) take custom Nodes as props, 2) edit and remove nodes that already exisits on the canvas 3) export the canvas as JSON or PDF file.
- **Additional Data Input Components:** we plan on creating additional input/parameter components that integrate with our data flow system and can be used when composing custom Nodes.

- **Extensive Test Converage:** We expect to have full E2E and unit test coverage relatively soon.
